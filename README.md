# AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System

A multi-agent customer support automation system built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **Ollama**, **FAISS**, and **SQLite**.

The system classifies customer queries, routes them to specialized AI agents, retrieves information from a knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), maintains conversation history, supports human approval for sensitive requests, and performs a final supervisor review before generating the response.
